the 'chmod' command which stands for 'change mode'. Using the command, we can set permissions (read, write, execute) on a file/directory for the owner, group and the world. Syntax:

"chmod permissions filename"


Changing Ownership and Group
For changing the ownership of a file/directory, you can use the following command:

chown user


In case you want to change the user as well as group for a file or directory use the command

chown user:group filename
